# pomogui

I wanted to make this pomogui for a long time. Finally started today. 

While coding I usually listen to LoFi girl or some similar channel. Usually on low volume. 

Im also using the pomodoro technique ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)) while studying/coding. Its a nice way to get regular breaks, while focusing maximum when you are in an active pomo. 

### Requirements
You need **mpv** and **yt-dlp** installed for playing the LoFi girl radio. On Ubuntu thats just: 
```bash
sudo apt install mpv
pip install yt-dlp
```
If you already have yt-dlp and mpv, you might need to update yt-dlp to the newest version. You can do so with:
```bash
pip install --upgrade 
# or
yt-dlp -U
```
